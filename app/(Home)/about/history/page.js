        The Importance of Education in Somalia
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Education is a fundamental human right and a precondition for restoring peace, prosperity, and justice in Somalia. The collapse of the Somali state in the 1990s and the subsequent civil wars devastated the education sector, leaving an entire generation without access to proper schooling. The restoration of regular schooling and universities is crucial for rebuilding the nation and securing a better future.

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        Education provides structure and stability for children and adults who have been affected by war. It is the foundation for creating a skilled workforce that can compete in the global economy. Additionally, it fosters intellectual discipline, promotes civic values, and contributes to good governance.

        Recognizing the urgent need for education, a group of intellectuals and members of the Somali diaspora** initiated the establishment of JOBKEY University. After more than three years of research and consultation, JOBKEY University was officially launched in August 2011, marking a significant step toward restoring higher education in Somalia.
